# Info

This application has been made with Three js, I used a tutorial to make the intro, I customized it (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/star-wars-crawl-text/). Also used a video to have an ambiance animation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bed1z7f1EI4). The other things are made by me. Some ideas are from Lucas Rossignol
